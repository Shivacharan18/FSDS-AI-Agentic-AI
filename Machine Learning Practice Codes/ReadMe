This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Machine Learning codes implemented in Python, covering the complete workflow from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building, evaluation, and optimization. The projects include both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms such as Linear and Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, KNN, and K-Means clustering, using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The code is well-structured and intended for academic learning, practice, and reference, making it suitable for assignments, exam preparation, and understanding practical machine learning concepts.
